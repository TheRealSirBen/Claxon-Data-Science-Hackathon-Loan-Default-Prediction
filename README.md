## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the probability of default on loans using historical loan
data. The model is crucial for risk management and strategic planning in financial institutions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical information about borrowers, including various features that may impact the probability
of default. (Detailed description of the dataset would be added here)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```

pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

## Usage

1. To train the model:
   - Open and run the `train_model.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. To start the FastAPI server:
   ```

uvicorn main:app --reload

   ```

3. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: (Describe the data cleaning techniques used and justify decisions)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: (Summarize key findings from EDA, including visualizations and interesting observations)

3. **Feature Selection**: (Explain the feature selection methods and justify choices)

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: (Describe the hyperparameter tuning process and rationale)

5. **Cross Validation**: (Explain the cross-validation strategy and report evaluation metrics)

6. **Feature Scaling and Transformation**: (Discuss scaling and transformation techniques applied)

7. **Model Building**: (Describe the 5+ models trained, explain algorithm choices, and discuss assumptions and limitations)

## Model Performance

(Provide details on model evaluation, including performance metrics on the validation set)

## API Endpoints

The FastAPI application in `main.py` serves the trained model. Key endpoints include:

- `/predict`: Endpoint for model prediction
- `/train`: Endpoint for model training

(Provide more detailed documentation on how to use these endpoints)

## Data Drift Detection

(Explain the implemented mechanism for detecting data drift and its importance for model maintenance)

## Model Analysis

- Feature Importance: (Interpret model coefficients or feature importances)
- Error Analysis: (Investigate instances where the model performs poorly)
- Bias Analysis: (Analyze the model for biases in predictions)
- Interpretability: (Explain how the model is making predictions)

## Model Limitations

(Clearly communicate the limitations of the model, acknowledging situations where it might not perform well)

## Future Improvements

(Propose potential enhancements or future directions for model improvement)

## Business Implications

(Discuss potential business implications of your findings)
